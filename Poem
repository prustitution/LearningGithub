In the realm of logic and gears,
Where engineering prowess steers,
There dwell a quirky group, my dears,
The engineers, who conquer fears.

With pencils behind their ears,
They scribble plans, erasing smears,
Their minds filled with numbers and gears,
They calculate through sleepless years.

In a world of complex machinery,
They find joy in mathematical symphony,
Solving problems with utmost glee,
Their brains buzzing like a busy bee.
