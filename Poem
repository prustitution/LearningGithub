In the realm of logic and gears,
Where engineering prowess steers,
There dwell a quirky group, my dears,
The engineers, who conquer fears.

With pencils behind their ears,
They scribble plans, erasing smears,
Their minds filled with numbers and gears,
They calculate through sleepless years.

In a world of complex machinery,
They find joy in mathematical symphony,
Solving problems with utmost glee,
Their brains buzzing like a busy bee.

They'll fix a gadget in a flash,
With wires tangled, they won't clash,
Their tools they'll swiftly stash,
For engineers, problems are just a splash.

Their jokes may seem a bit askew,
As if written by a mad hatter, it's true,
But their laughter is contagious, it grew,
For engineers find humor in what they do.

They'll laugh at puns that make no sense,
Jokes about circuits and electric fence,
With laughter that's genuine and immense,
Their witty minds, an engineering defense.

So let's raise a toast to engineers,
The brilliant minds that calm our fears,
They build the bridges, they shift the gears,
And make our world a better place, my dears!
